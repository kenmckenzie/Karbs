# Ken's port of (LARBS) which deploy's my own dotfiles (karbs, get it..... :) )

This is a edited fork of LARBS from https://github.com/lukesmithxyz which deploy's my own dotfiles based on qtile window manager with
custom forks of both st and dmenu, it strives to provide a keyboard centric desktop workflow that can also be mouse 
driven when the need arises (I do not believe in making my system obtuse for the sake of it)

# Installation instructions
Simple, clone the repo and run karbs.sh . Once complete boot into qtile and run setbg in terminal to set 
the colorscheme to the default wallpaper(or you are welcome to use another as an argument to the script)

# Credits
Huge thanks to Luke Smith who saved me a ton of time implementing this myself. Please support him if you
find this usefull


Only testing for now, not ready
